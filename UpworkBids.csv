React,Redux,Node,REST API,MongoDB,Typescript,Javascript,AngularJS,jQuery;"Hi there,

Reading your job description, I'm very excited and interested in this opportunity.

I always wanted to work for an innovative start-up company where I can work creatively to contribute to the successful growth of the company. I've consistently loved challenges and it's one of the reasons why I prefer start-up companies. And I think your company is what I've been looking for.

I have 9+ years of hands-on experience in web & mobile development across various industries, with the five most recent years focused on JavaScript frameworks such as React/Next.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and more.

 Most recently, I worked as a front-end engineer at Capital Numbers, a software development agency dedicated to serving clients globally in the digital marketing space. I was involved in a creative and passionate dev team and developed several Ecommerce and SaaS platforms for 3 different clients ranging from start to deployment.

During work there I:
- Developed Single Page Web Application with React/Vue.js, Redux, Express.js, Node.js, REST API, and MongoDB
- Coded pages with best Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques
- Maintenance and bug fixes of existing site, involving a wide variety of technologies including React.js/Redux, AngularJS and jQuery
- Worked with unit testing of JavaScript applications using Jasmine, Jest and Integration test

I've worked for innovative companies for my entire career, and I relish the opportunity to wear many hats and work with the team to succeed. I'm now interested in finding a Senior Engineer role at a company that prioritizes empathetic, values-first results.

I believe I will be a great asset to your company. I enjoy challenges and although I can work alone, I prefer to work in a team, which is another reason I want to apply to your company.

I would be thrilled to be a part of your team, and I hope to speak with you soon about your needs for the role.

Kind regards";0
